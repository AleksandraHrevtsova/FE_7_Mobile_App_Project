        <h3>HTML5</h3>
        <p>HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it.
          HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.

        <h3>GIT</h3>
        <p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
          It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
          Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
